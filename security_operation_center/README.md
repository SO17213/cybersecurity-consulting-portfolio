# Security Operations Center (SOC)

This section highlights my experience supporting 24/7 SOC environments, including Tier 1â€“3 responsibilities, tooling, metrics, and real-world escalations.

## ðŸ”¸ Key Responsibilities

- **Alert triage and analysis** using Splunk, CrowdStrike Falcon, Proofpoint TAP, and Netskope.

- **Detection tuning**: Creating Jira tickets to Detection Engineering to reduce false positives and improve fidelity.
- **Dashboard creation** in Splunk and Kibana for leadership visibility on key SOC metrics.
- **Threat hunting** across AWS, Okta, macOS, and Windows environments.

1. Alert triggered for Okta login from unusual IP.
