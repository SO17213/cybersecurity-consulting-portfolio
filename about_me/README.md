# 👋 Hi, I'm Segun Oladipo

I'm a cybersecurity professional with expertise across detection engineering, incident response, cloud security, forensics, and red teaming. This portfolio showcases some of my work in sanitized form, including playbooks, labs, detection logic, and automation.

## 💼 What I Do

I help organizations:
- Build and tune high-fidelity detections across cloud, endpoint, and SaaS environments
- Investigate alerts and incidents with speed and accuracy
- Deploy and configure EDR solutions across Windows and macOS
- Automate repetitive triage tasks with SOAR tools and Jira workflows
- Evaluate and implement security tools (e.g., Zscaler, Netskope, CrowdStrike, BeyondTrust EPM, CyberArk, Google SecOps/Chronicle)
- Conduct forensic investigations of compromised systems
- Simulate attacks and develop detections for red-team behaviors
- Support SOC teams with escalation workflows, analyst enablement, and detection improvements
